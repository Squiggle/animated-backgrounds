## Using animated-backgrounds

### via CDN

Referencing the web-components via CDN directly as a `<link ...` in your html page:

1. Add link
2. Wrap any block-level element with the appropriate tag.

See examples for individual snippets.

### via npm

1. `npm install thing`
2. import?
3. I don't know how this works, exactly.
